*AIG100 – Project 2: Regression and Classification Methods*

*Overview*

*This project is to explore applications of regression and classification methods in solving real-world*

*problems using machine learning. You will select datasets and apply appropriate regression and*

*classification methods to predict outcomes and classify data points, respectively. Be reminded that this*

*may look the same as the labs you have completed but this is more comprehensive, and expectations are*

*higher. Moreover, please use a different dataset from your labs. If you wish to use the same dataset,*

*then choose a different model to solve your problem. The aim here is not to redo what you have already*

*implemented! You are free to use any relevant tools/platforms for this project.*

*Please note: being able to identify important issues, and to communicate them well, is critical in this*

*field. Please choose the material you present carefully, ensuring that it is important/informative.*

*Poor presentation, such as including excessive plots, including output/plots without interpretation,*

*writing excessive amounts of text, etc., will be penalized. You should aim to be concise: present what*

*is important, briefly, informatively, and accurately.*

*Remember that Jupyter notebooks are intended to incorporate both code/output and report. Please do*

*not submit separate reports.*

*Objectives*

*•* *To understand and apply regression methods to predict numerical outcomes.*

*•* *To utilize classification methods to categorize data into predefined labels.*

*•* *To evaluate and compare the performance of different regression and classification*

*models.*

*•* *To interpret and communicate the results of the analysis effectively.*

*Tasks*

*1.* *Dataset Selection and Objective Definition*

*a.* *Choose a dataset for each task: one for regression and another for classification.*

*• As discussed in class, each set should have an appropriate column to use as a*

*target variable (i.e., the variable should be both of correct datatype, and of*

*interest to predict), and useful features.*

*b.* *Define clear objectives for what you aim to predict or classify.*

*2.* *Data Preprocessing*

*a.* *Clean the data, handling missing values and outliers.*

*b.* *Perform any necessary transformations to prepare the data for modeling.*

*3.* *Model Implementation*

*a.* *For regression: Apply at least two different regression techniques (e.g., linear*

*regression, decision trees).*

*b.* *For classification: Implement at least two classification methods (e.g., logistic*

*regression, SVM).*

*4.* *Model Evaluation*

*a.* *Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics.*

*b.* *Compare the performance of the models and discuss any findings.*

*5.* *Results Interpretation*

*a.* *Interpret the results of your models.*

*b.* *Create visualizations to present your findings (where possible/applicable).*

*6.* *Report Writing*

*a.* *Document your process, findings, and conclusions in a detailed report.*

*b.* *Besides the necessary sections, include a section on the potential implications of your*

*results in real-world scenarios.*

*c.* *Provide references (e.g. code, blogs, GenAI tools).*

*7.* *Reflection*

*a.* *Reflect on the challenges faced during the project and how they were addressed.*

*b.* *Discuss any insights gained from applying regression and classification*

*techniques.*

*(The points above explain the requirements for the project, but they do not constitute a list of topics to*

*include in your report! For example, it will be strange to include a ‘Report Writing’ section… It should be*

*obvious which elements should be report sections. Moreover, please report on each dataset separately:*

*one dataset’s entire selection/preprocessing/implementation/evaluation/interpretation/etc., before*

*reporting all of those elements for the second dataset.)*

*Submission*

*Implement everything in a Jupyter Notebook file. Make sure that code is written in code cells and textual*

*explanations are written in Markdown cells. You need to run your notebook so that visualizations are*

*saved in the submitted notebook. Submit your completed Jupyter Notebook file through the submission*

*link in Blackboard.*
