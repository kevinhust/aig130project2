Below is a structured summary of the key knowledge points from the specified slide sets, based on the provided file contents. I've organized them by slide set, focusing on the main concepts, examples, methods, and visualizations. This is in English, as requested, and tailored for quiz preparation (e.g., emphasizing definitions, tests, examples, and interpretations).

### Slide Set 7: Fitting Discrete Distributions (Slides 31-39: Remaining Slides Not Covered on the Midterm)
These slides focus on methods for fitting and assessing discrete distributions (e.g., Poisson, negative binomial) to data, including visualization techniques to evaluate goodness-of-fit. Key emphasis is on rootograms for comparing observed vs. fitted frequencies.

- **Fitting Discrete Distributions (Slide 31)**:
  - Process of selecting and fitting models like Poisson or negative binomial to count data.
  - Goal: Assess how well a distribution matches observed frequencies (e.g., using maximum likelihood estimation).

- **Rootograms (Slides 32-34)**:
  - **Problems with Standard Plots**: Largest frequencies dominate visuals; difficult to assess deviations from the fitted curve.
  - **Hanging Rootograms**: A visualization where square roots of frequencies are plotted, with bars "hanging" from the fitted curve. Helps highlight deviations (positive/negative residuals) more clearly than raw frequency plots.
  - **Deviation Rootograms**: Similar to hanging rootograms but focuses on deviations (residuals) from the fitted model. Useful for identifying over- or under-prediction in specific bins.
  - Purpose: Better assessment of goodness-of-fit by scaling (square root transformation) to reduce dominance of high frequencies and emphasize patterns in residuals.

- **Example: Federalist Papers (Slides 35-37)**:
  - Application to word frequency data from the Federalist Papers (authorship attribution problem).
  - Analyzes distributions of word counts (e.g., common words like "the" or "of").
  - Fits models like Poisson or negative binomial to word frequency distributions.
  - Visualizes using rootograms to check fit: e.g., if variance > mean (overdispersion), negative binomial may fit better than Poisson.

- **Word Frequency Examples (Slides 36-37)**:
  - Common in text analysis: Counts of word occurrences follow discrete distributions (e.g., log-series or zeta distributions for rare words).
  - Example: Fitting to observed word frequencies; use rootograms to compare fits and detect issues like overdispersion.
  - Key Insight: If σ² > μ, consider negative binomial over Poisson.

- **General Reminders**:
  - These tools help diagnose model misfit (e.g., overdispersion in Poisson).
  - Compare fits using metrics like χ² goodness-of-fit tests or visual inspection of rootograms.

### Slide Set 8: Stratified Contingency Tables & Visualizations
This set covers analyzing 2x2 tables stratified by a third variable (e.g., department), including visualizations for associations and paradoxes like Simpson's.

- **Overview and Examples**:
  - Stratified tables: 2x2xk structures (e.g., Admit/Reject x Gender x Department).
  - Berkeley Admissions Data: Examines gender bias in graduate admissions (males admitted at higher rates overall: 44.52% vs. 30.35% for females; odds ratio 0.802 vs. 0.437).
  - Question: Is there association between gender and admission? Strength? Significance? Visualization?

- **Mosaic Displays**:
  - Visualizes multi-way tables: Tile areas proportional to frequencies.
  - Stratified mosaics show pairwise associations (e.g., Admit x Gender by Dept).
  - Mosaic matrix: Displays all pairwise views (e.g., shading for residuals indicating association).

- **Fourfold Plots**:
  - For 2x2 tables: Area ~ frequency (nij); blue (+) for positive residuals, red (-) for negative.
  - Unstandardized: Odds ratio as ratio of blue/red cell products.
  - Standardized: Adjusts for margins; intense shading for significant associations.
  - Stratified Version: Plots by strata (e.g., departments); shows varying associations (e.g., bias in some depts but not others).
  - Example: Cholesterol data (low/high cholesterol x no/yes disease).

- **Stratified Odds-Ratio Plots**:
  - Plots log odds ratios (LOR) for Admit/Gender by department.
  - Visualizes direction and strength of association across strata (e.g., points with confidence intervals).

- **Simpson’s Paradox**:
  - Aggregate data can mislead: Overall male advantage in Berkeley data reverses in some departments.
  - Explanation: Confounding by strata (e.g., women apply more to low-admission departments; men to high-admission ones).
  - Does not address structural bias (e.g., funding differences in fields).
  - Another Example: Kidney stone treatments (aggregated vs. stratified results differ due to confounding).

- **Key Tests and Concepts**:
  - Association measures: Odds ratios, % admitted.
  - Tests: χ² for significance.
  - Visualization aids in detecting bias and paradoxes.

### Slide Set 9: Additional 2-Way Table Visualizations (More 2-Way Techniques)
This set extends 2-way (rxc) table analysis, including ordered categories, small samples, visualizations, and agreement measures.

- **Examples with Ordered Categories**:
  - Mental Health Data: Mental impairment (Well/Mild/Moderate/Impaired) x Parents' SES (1-6 levels).
  - SES as predictor, impairment as response; tests for ordered associations.

- **Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) Tests for Ordinal Variables**:
  - More powerful than Pearson χ² for ordered rows/columns (uses scores like 1,2,3...).
  - Types:
    - **Nonzero Correlation**: For both ordinal; CMH χ² = (N-1)r²; tests linear association (highest power for trends).
    - **Row/Column Mean Scores Differ**: For one ordinal variable; like Kruskal-Wallis (ANOVA on ranks).
    - **General Association**: For nominal variables; similar to Pearson χ²/LR G².
  - Output: χ²/df comparison (higher = stronger evidence).
  - Example: Mental data shows significant correlation (χ²=37.2, p<0.001).

- **Small Sample Sizes**:
  - Pearson χ²/LR G² invalid if expected frequencies <5; use Fisher's Exact Test (exact p-value for all more extreme tables) or simulated p-values.
  - Example: Cholesterol x Disease (small n); Fisher's p=0.039, odds ratio ~7.4.

- **Plots for 2-Way Tables**:
  - **Bar Plots**: Frequency bars; often not useful for associations.
  - **Spine Plots**: Marginal proportions for one variable; conditional for the other. Independence: Aligned cells.
  - **Tile Plots**: Matrix of tiles; scalable by cells/rows/cols for comparisons.
  - **Sieve Diagrams**: Area ~ expected frequency; shading density ~ observed (blue/red for residuals). Uniform shading = independence.
    - Effect Ordering: Reorder rows/cols for coherent patterns.
    - Examples: Hair/Eye color; Vision acuity (diagonal association + off-diagonal patterns).

- **Observer Agreement**:
  - For square tables (e.g., Rater1 x Rater2); assesses reliability (e.g., diagnostic categories).
  - **Agreement vs. Association**: Strong association possible without agreement; check marginal homogeneity.
  - **Cohen’s Kappa (κ)**:
    - Measures agreement beyond chance: κ = (Po - Pc) / (1 - Pc), where Po = observed agreement (diagonal), Pc = chance (marginal products).
    - Properties: κ=1 (perfect), can be <0; unweighted (exact matches), weighted (partial credit for near-agreement, e.g., Cicchetti-Allison or Fleiss-Cohen weights).
    - Example: Couples' ratings of "Sex is fun" (unweighted κ low, weighted higher).
  - **Agreement Charts**: Visualizes weighted/unweighted agreement (e.g., bubbles for off-diagonals).
  - Intraclass Correlation: For multiple raters (ANOVA-based).

- **General Reminders**:
  - For ordered data: CMH > Pearson χ² in power.
  - Visualizations reveal patterns (e.g., sieve for independence, fourfold for odds).
  - Square tables: Test symmetry/quasi-symmetry.
